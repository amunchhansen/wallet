# @canton-network/core-tx-clear-signing

Describes what a Canton prepared transaction does, in words, before it is signed. Each root node (a create or an exercise) is described by a _clear-signing descriptor_: a JSON document bound to one exact Daml template (package ID, module and entity), with a stable intent, an interpolated intent and typed fields.

The descriptor format is the v1 _Canton Clear Signing Descriptor_ schema, modelled on ERC-7730. The tests run the schema's own valid and invalid examples (`src/__tests__/schema-examples`, copied unchanged from the schema's repository) through the parser `clearSign` uses, so the parser and the schema cannot drift apart.

## Usage

```typescript
import { clearSign } from '@canton-network/core-tx-clear-signing'

// preparedTransaction and preparedTransactionHash: base64, as returned by
// /v2/interactive-submission/prepare. descriptors: any number of descriptors.
const { complete, operations } = await clearSign(
    preparedTransaction,
    descriptors,
    preparedTransactionHash
)
// operations[0].intent: 'Ping "04d887dd-…" from alice::1220… to alice::1220…'
// operations[0].fields: [{ label: 'Ping ID', value: '"04d887dd-…"' }, …]
```

The package exports `clearSign`, `HashMismatchError`, and the types `ClearSigningResult` and `Descriptor`.

Three fixed transactions in [examples/](examples) run `clearSign` on their own. Each prints the wording, and exits with an error if that wording changes:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx core/tx-clear-signing/examples/ping.ts
pnpm exec tsx core/tx-clear-signing/examples/allocation.ts
pnpm exec tsx core/tx-clear-signing/examples/showcase.ts
```

## Input

- **The transaction**, base64. Unknown protobuf fields are refused.
- **Descriptors**, any number. A descriptor binds to the roots whose template has its package ID, module and entity. A descriptor that binds to no root is ignored.
- **The hash** the user is asked to approve, base64. The transaction is described only when its bytes hash to this value, under scheme V3 or V2. Otherwise `clearSign` throws `HashMismatchError`.

## Output

The output follows ERC-7730: one sentence and a list of label/value fields per operation.

```typescript
interface ClearSigningResult {
    complete: boolean // every root described, every field has a value
    operations: {
        kind: 'create' | 'exercise' | 'other'
        template?: TemplateRef // from the transaction
        choiceId?: string // from the transaction
        interface?: TemplateRef // from the transaction
        status:
            | 'described'
            | 'fallback'
            | 'undescribed'
            | 'invalid'
            | 'undescribable'
        reason?: string // why invalid or undescribable
        descriptor?: { name; publisher; version; url? } // the bound descriptor's claim
        intent: string
        fields: ({ label; value: string } | { label; error: string })[]
    }[]
}
```

`intent` is, in order of preference:

1. `described`: the descriptor's `interpolatedIntent`, with each `{path}` replaced by its field's value. An operation without one shows its stable `intent`.
2. `fallback`: a placeholder's field could not be shown, so the descriptor's stable `intent`, as ERC-7730 does.
3. `undescribed`, `invalid`, `undescribable`: a generic sentence, `Create Module:Entity` or `Exercise Choice on Module:Entity`. `undescribed`: no descriptor words the node. `invalid`: the bound descriptor fails validation, or two descriptors bind the template. `undescribable`: the node is not a create or an exercise, or the contract it exercises is missing, repeated or of another template.

A Daml `Text` value is shown as a JSON string literal, in the intent and in its field, so a value such as `x" and send 1000 to "Mallory` cannot pass as the descriptor's wording. Control, format and line-separator characters in values are escaped.

`kind`, `template`, `choiceId` and `interface` are read from the transaction, so a descriptor cannot change which action the user is told about. `descriptor` is unauthenticated in v1: descriptors carry no verified signature yet.

`complete` is false when any root is not `described` or any field has an error. A wallet should warn the user then. `clearSign` throws only on a hash mismatch and on a transaction it cannot read or hash.

## How it works

[src/clear-sign.ts](src/clear-sign.ts) checks the hash, then:

1. **Decodes** the transaction ([src/roots.ts](src/roots.ts)), and indexes the contracts an exercise can act on: the input contracts, and the contracts the transaction creates.
2. **Binds** each root template to its descriptor, and validates that descriptor ([src/descriptor.ts](src/descriptor.ts)).
3. **Selects** the entry: `create` for a create node. For an exercise, the `exercises` entry whose choice and interface both equal the node's. An entry without an interface matches only the template's own choice.
4. **Resolves fields** ([src/path.ts](src/path.ts)) and **formats** them ([src/format.ts](src/format.ts)). A path starts at the create or choice argument. In an exercise, a `@.contract.` path starts at the create argument of the exercised contract.
5. **Interpolates** the intent ([src/intent.ts](src/intent.ts)).

Only root nodes are described. A child node is a consequence of its root's choice, which the root's descriptor words. Every root is shown, described or not.

The exercised contract must have the exercise's package name, module and entity. Its package ID may differ, because an upgrade keeps the package name. This is the one place where the package ID is not matched exactly.

## Optional values

A field fails on `None`. The ledger leaves trailing `None` fields out of a record, so a record field that is not in the record is `None` too; so is a mistyped path. `Some` is unwrapped at every step of a path.

Set `optional: true` when the path may pass through an `Optional`. `None` is then shown as `None`, and a `Some` with the field's `format`.

The descriptors the wallet gateways ship, and merging uploads over them, live in `@canton-network/core-wallet-services/clear-signing`.
